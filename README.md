# Thermostat
programmable thermostat for church use using arduino and LCDkeypad
The church needs a programmable thermostat. It needs to consider changes for scheduled meetings and events, and it needs to be able to respond to irregular meetings. However commertcial versions are too inflexible. Users misunderstand how to make temporary changes and mess with the stored programs, leave the settings permanently on, etc. We need a thermostat which allows a temporary change within temperature limits and for short time periods, returning to the stored program automatically.
My plan is to use an Arduino with a temperature sensor, LCDkeypad, relay and power-supply/battery to replace the standard thermostat.]
Power will be stored from the furnace transformer while idle and drawn from the battery while demanding heat (thermostat wires shorted).
Future plans include wi-fi link to a webpage allowing remote requests shortly before meetings.
